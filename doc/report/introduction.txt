As the developing of Software Defined Networking(SDN),
the devices in the network are becoming more and more programmable \cite{Reitblatt:2011:CUS:2070562.2070569}.
Therefore a lot of problems in network can be handled more easily.
One of the most popular solutions to SDN is the OpenFlow protocol,
which provides a less costly way to achieve both high performance and reasonable programmability \cite{McKeown:2008:OEI:1355734.1355746}.

Load balancing is an important method to distribute workloads across servers
and it is widely adapted in the area of computer networking.
The typical way to implement it is using some dedicated load-balancers.
However, these load-balancers are expensive and not flexible.
With the help of OpenFlow,
The SDN based load-balancing is flourishing dramatically \cite{Wang:2011:OSL:1972422.1972438}.

Our project is to use NS-3 simulator to explore different aspects and possibilities in OpenFlow based load-balancing.
